# Dependencies for hosting a server..
# 1. Java JRE and JDK
   So you can even open the java file, you need the Java JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and JDK (Java Development Kit)
   Download: JRE (https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) JDK (https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.msi)]
# 2. VPN (Optional)
     When you host a server, you will have to host it on your machine. and the IP will be your IP
     You dont have to do this if your only gonna use your server to chat with family or close friends, but for security reasons we highly suggest using a VPN
     you dont have to, though.
     You can also alternatively use a VPS or a VM to host your server.

# 3. An internet connection
This probably speaks for itself, but you need a internet connection to host a server.

# SETUP (READ)
If you havent read the other things, thats still relatively fine. but if you dont read this, you wont be able to setup a server.

# GETTING YOUR SERVER PORT..
So that the people on the Wavern client can connect, you need to get the port.
1. Edit the Server.Java file by right clicking on it and pressing edit
2. Go to the bottom of the code and locate the line that says "ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);"
3. You can change this to anything you want, you can also keep the default one but make sure to check if the port is not already in use!
4. Get your servers IP Address, heres how you can locate it:

# IF YOUR HOSTING IT ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE..

# For windows:
Go to the command prompt and type in "ipconfig"
scroll down to the bottom and locate the line that says "ipv4 address"
copy it
give this to your friends and tell them to join using that IP.

# For MacOS:
Go to the terminal and type "ipconfig getifaddr en1"
copy that and give it to your friends and tell them to join using that IP
if that doesnt work, try "curl ifconfig.me".

# For Linux
1. "curl ifconfig.me"
2. "ifconfig -a"
